# Simple Linked Products - Module for Prestashop v1.7

Simple Linked Products is a tiny module which allow merchants to link a product to another.
The module is useful in the case you want to propose to your customers :

- a physical product in it's virtual version
- or the inverse side
- or what you want to link to

Ex : sell a physical book version and propose the same in e-book.

## How it works

- Simple Linked Products add a field into the Prestashop's product table in DB.
- In the back office > product edit page > modules tabs, a search field is displayed.
- This field allows you to search for a product to link and link it to the current one. 
- In the front product page, a button appears with one of theses Labels :

-- "Virtual version" : if the original product is physical and the linked is virtual
-- "Physical version" : if the inverse
-- "Other version" : if both are physical or virtual

- User click on this button to access the other version and can return to the previous one if you have linked the both products together (eg : book linked to e-book and e-book linked to book) 

## Install

- Just upload the module in .zip into Prestashop

## Requirements

- In the case you have a book and you would like to sell the same thing in e-book version, you have to duplicate your book product or create a new one and convert it into a virtual product.
- For user experience, you should link the both products in the both sides
